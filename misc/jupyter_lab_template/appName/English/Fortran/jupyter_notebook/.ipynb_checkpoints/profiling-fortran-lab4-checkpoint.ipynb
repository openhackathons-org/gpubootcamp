    "Learn how to improve the performance of the application by managing data movement and reducing the unnecessary data transfers. In this exercise you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about unified memory and how to automatically migrate data between CPU and GPU\n",
    "- Learn how to use it via PGI compiler managed option, and profiling managed memory\n",
    "- Learn how to identify redundant memory copies via Nsight Systems\n",
    "- Learn how to improve efficiency by reducing extra data copies via OpenACC data directive\n",
    "- Learn how to use PGI compiler feedback as a guidance on where to insert the OpenACC data directives\n",
    "- Apply data directives to the parallel application, benchmark and profile it\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's inspect the profiler report from previous exercise. From the \"timeline view\" on the top pane, double click on the \"CUDA\" from the function table on the left and expand it. Zoom in on the timeline and you can see a pattern similar to the screenshot below. The blue boxes are the compute kernels and each of these groupings of kernels is surrounded by purple and teal boxes (annotated with red color) representing data movements.\n",

    "The compiler feedback is telling us that the compiler has inserted data movement around our parallel region at line 277 which copies the `hy_dens_cell`, `hy_dens_theta_cell`, and `state` arrays in and out of GPU memory and also copies `flux` array out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler can only work with the information we provide. It knows we need the `hy_dens_cell`, `hy_dens_theta_cell`, `state`, and `flux` arrays on the GPU for the accelerated section within the  `compute_tendencies_x` function, but we didn't tell the compiler anything about what happens to the data outside of those sections. Without this knowledge, the compiler has to copy the full arrays to the GPU and back to the CPU for each accelerated section. This is a lot of unnecessary data transfers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would want to move the data (example: `hy_dens_cell`, `hy_dens_theta_cell`, `state` arrays) to the GPU at the beginning, and only transfer back to the CPU at the end (if needed). And as for the `flux` array in this example, we do not need to copy any data back and forth. So we only need to create space on the device (GPU) for this array. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to give the compiler information about how to reduce the extra and unnecessary data movement. By adding OpenACC `data` directive to a structured code block, the compiler will know how to manage data according to the clauses.
