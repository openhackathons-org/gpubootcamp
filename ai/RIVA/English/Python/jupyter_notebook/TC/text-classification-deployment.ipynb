    "# Deploying Text Classification Model in Riva\n",
    "\n",
    "[Transfer Learning Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/transfer-learning-toolkit) (TLT) provides the capability to export your model in a format that can deployed using [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva), a highly performant application framework for multi-modal conversational AI services using GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores taking an .riva model, the result of `tlt text_classification export` command, and leveraging the Riva ServiceMaker framework to aggregate all the necessary artifacts for Riva deployment to a target environment. Once the model is deployed in Riva, you can issue inference requests to the server. We will demonstrate how quick and straightforward this whole process is. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:  \n",
    "- Use Riva ServiceMaker to take a TLT exported .riva and convert it to .rmir\n",
    "- Deploy the model(s) locally  on the Riva Server\n",
    "- Send inference requests from a demo client using Riva API bindings..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "To follow along, please make sure:\n",
    "- You have access to NVIDIA NGC, and are able to download the Riva Quickstart [resources]https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/resources/nvidia:riva:riva_quickstart/)\n",
    "- Have an .riva model file that you wish to deploy. You can obtain this from `tlt <task> export` (with `export_format=RIVA`). Please refer the tutorial on *Text Classification using Transfer Learning Toolkit* for more details on training and exporting an .riva model which was covered in the previous notebook.\n",
    "- Have followed the steps in the setup notebook to setup and deploy an instance of the RIVA Framework and have a running RIVA server\n",
