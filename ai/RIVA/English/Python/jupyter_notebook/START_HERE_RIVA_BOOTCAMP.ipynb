    "This repository consists of gpu bootcamp material for RIVA. The RIVA frameworks of libraries, APIs and models allows you to build, optimize and deploy voice and speech centric applications and models based entirely on GPUs. In this series you can access RIVA learning resources in the form of labs. The modules covered in this Bootcamp are SpeechToText, Intent Slot Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Question-Answering and Challenge. To access each module individually, you can refer to the respective folders in this repository. "
