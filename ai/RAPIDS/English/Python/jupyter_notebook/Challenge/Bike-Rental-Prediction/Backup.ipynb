    "# Bike Rental Prediction Challenge- Workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through an end-to-end GPU machine learning workflow where cuDF is used for processing the data and cuML is used to train machine learning models on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this excercise, you will be able to use cuDF to load data from disk, combine tables, scale features, use one-hote encoding and even write your own GPU kernels to efficiently transform feature columns. Additionaly you will learn how to pass this data to cuML, and how to train ML models on it. The trained model is saved and it will be used for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not required that the user is familiar with cuDF or cuML. Since our aim is to go from ETL to ML training, a detailed introduction is out of scope for this notebook. We recommend [Introduction to cuDF](../../CuDF/01-Intro_to_cuDF.ipynb)  for additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to predict daily demand for short-term bike rentals made in 2011 and 2012. We will combine three data sources: bike rental information, historical weather data, and dates of public holidays. In Section 2 of this notebook we will use cuDF to combine these data into a single dataset that can be used as an input for machine learning algorithms.  In Section 3 we train models using cuML to predict bike rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Why RAPIDS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the GPU accelerated libraries from RAPIDS greatly reduces the execution time of a data science workflow. This leads to faster iteration with data preparation and model selection, and overall a more efficient workflow. \n",

    "This notebook is inspired by the [blog article](https://medium.com/rapids-ai/essential-machine-learning-with-linear-models-in-rapids-part-1-of-a-series-992fab0240da) from Paul Mahler and its accompanying [notebook](https://github.com/rapidsai-community/notebooks-contrib/blob/master/blog_notebooks/regression/regression_blog_notebook.ipynb).

    "\n",
    "We have all now the data in a single table, but we still want to change their encoding. We're going to create one-hot encoded variables, also known as dummy variables, for each of the time variables as well as the weather situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary from https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The integer values have a natural ordered relationship between each other and machine learning algorithms may be able to understand and harness this relationship.\n",
    "For categorical variables where no such ordinal relationship exists, the integer encoding is not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, using this encoding and allowing the model to assume a natural ordering between categories may result in poor performance or unexpected results (predictions halfway between categories).\n",

    "We start by one-hot encoding the 'Weather' column using the [one_hot_encoding](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/nightly/api.html#cudf.core.dataframe.DataFrame.one_hot_encoding) method from cuDF DataFrame. This is very the [get_dummies](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/nightly/api.html#cudf.core.reshape.get_dummies) function (which might be more familiar for Pandas users), but one_hot_encoding works on a single input column and performs the operation in place.

Fortunately cuML is flexible with the [input format](https://medium.com/rapids-ai/input-and-output-configurability-in-rapids-cuml-e719d72c135b), and we can pass numpy array directly to it (at a cost of additional host to device copies, because under the hood cuML copies the data to the GPU). If the data size is reasonably small, then we can pay the price of additional data movement and  combine the convenience of GridSearchCV with the speed of cuML algorithms."
