    "# Applying CuDF: Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to third cuDF tutorial notebook! This is a practical example that utilizes cuDF and cuPy, geared primarily for new users. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce new users to a data science processing pipeline using RAPIDS on real life datasets. We will be working on a data science problem: US Accidents Prediction. This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset. \n",

    "## What should I do?\n",

    "Given below is a complete data science preprocessing pipeline for the dataset using Pandas and Numpy libraries. Using the methods and techniques from the previous notebooks, you have to convert this pipeline to a a RAPIDS implementation, using CuDF and CuPy. Don't forget to time your code cells and compare the performance with this original code, to understand why we are using RAPIDS. If you get stuck in the middle, feel free to refer to this sample solution. "

In the extra labs for future labs in CuML we will be using this processed dataset. You must have observed the parallels between the RAPIDS pipeline and traditional pipeline while writing your code. Try to experiment with the processing and making your code as efficient as possible. If you faced any difficulties in solving this exercise, refer to our sample solution notebook [here]((04-Cudf_Solution.ipynb))."
