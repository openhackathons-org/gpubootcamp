# This folder will contain all the previously created training material which are based on old frameworks or techniques which are deprecated. The idea is to keep the old bootcamp material for anyone using older hardware or software stack for learning purpose

To access the new HPC contents, please check below repositories:

| Lab      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [N-Ways](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/nways_accelerated_programming)      | This Bootcamp will cover multiple GPU programming models and choose the one that best fits your needs. The material supports different programming langauges including C ( CUDA C, OpenACC C, OpenMP C, C++ stdpar ),  Fortran ( CUDA Fortran, OpenACC Fortran, OpenMP Fortran, ISO DO CONCURRENT ) Python ( Numba, CuPy )       |
| [Multi GPU Programming Model](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/nways_multi_gpu)   | This bootcamp will cover scaling applications to multiple GPUs across multiple nodes. Moreover, understanding of the underlying technologies and communication topology will help us utilize high-performance NVIDIA libraries to extract more performance out of the system     |
| [HPC Profiler](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/HPC_Profiler)  | This repository contains learning materials and exercises for NVIDIA Nsight Tools. Goal is to learn how to profile your application with NVIDIA Nsight Systems,Compute and NVTX API calls to find performance limiters and bottlenecks and apply incremental parallelization strategies |
| [C++ Standard Parallelism](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/cpp_hpc_tutorial)  | This repository contains learning materials and exercises for C++ Standard Parallelism. The content covers step by steps of accelerating a portable HPC application with CPUs and GPUs using the parallelism and concurrency features of the C++17 and C++20 standards. Goal is to learn about C++ concurrency features like threads, atomics, barriers, and parallel algorithms. This forked content has been tested. The owners of the material are Gonzalo Brito and Jonas Latt|
