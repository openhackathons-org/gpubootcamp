    "This notebook give you a headstart in solving your own Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using neural networks. Let's quickly recap the theory of PINNs before proceeding. We will embed the physics of the problem in the the neural networks and in such setting, we can use them to approximate the solution to a given differential equation and boundary condition without any training data from other solvers. More specifically, the neural network will be trained to minimize a loss function which is formed using the differential equation and the boundary conditions. If the network is able to minimize this loss then it will in effect solve the given differential equation.

    "Now let’s look into adding constraints to this domain. This can be thought of as adding specific constraints to the neural network optimization. For this physics-driven problem, these constraints are the boundary conditions and equation residuals. The goal is to satisfy the boundary conditions exactly, and ideally have the PDE residuals to go 0. These constraints can be specified within Modulus using classes like `PointwiseBoundaryConstrant` and `PointwiseInteriorConstraint`. A L2 loss (defult and can be modified) is then constructed from these constraints which is used by the optimizer to minimize on. Specifying the constraints in this fashion is called soft-constraints.  \n",

    "\n",
    "A boundary can be sampled using `PointwiseBoundaryConstraint` class. This will sample the entire boundary of the geometry we specify in the `geometry` argument, in this case, both the endpoints of the 1d line. A particular boundary of the geometry can be sub-sampled by using a particular criterion using the `criteria` parameter. For example, to sample the left end of `L1`, `criteria` is set to `Eq(x, 0)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The desired values for the boundary condition are listed as a dictionary in `outvar` argument. For this problem,  we have `'u_1':0` at $x=0$ and `'u_2':100` at $x=2$. At $x=1$, we have the interface condition `'diffusion_interface_dirichlet_u_1_u_2':0` and `'diffusion_interface_neumann_u_1_u_2':0` that we defined earlier (i.e. $U_1=U_2$ and $D_1\\frac{dU_1}{dx}=D_2\\frac{dU_2}{dx}$). These dictionaries are then used when unrolling the computational graph (specified using the `nodes` argument) for training.\n",

Again, the appropriate geometry is specified in the `geometry` argument; the equations to solve are specified as a dictionary input to `outvar` argument. These dictionaries are then used when unrolling the computational graph (specified using the `nodes` argument) for training.\n",

The parameter `bounds`, determines the range for sampling the values for variables $x$ and $y$. The optional `lambda` parameter can be used to determine the weights for different losses. In this problem, we weight the loss on each point equally, and hence it is not used (defaults to 1) in this problem."

This allows us significant computational advantage, as one can now use PINNs to solve for multiple designs/cases in a single training. Once the training is complete, it is possible to run inference on several geometry/physical parameter combinations as a post-processing step, without solving the forward problem again. \n",

The value for this key can be in the range we specified earlier and which we would like to validate against. It is possible to create multiple validators if required, eg. different $D_1$ values. For monitor domain, similar `invar_numpy` is generated that has both the `'x'` and `'D1'` keys and appropriate arrays. "
