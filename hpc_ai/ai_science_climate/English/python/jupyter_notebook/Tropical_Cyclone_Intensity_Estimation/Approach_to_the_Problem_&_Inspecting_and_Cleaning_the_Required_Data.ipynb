    "\n",
    "1. **Data**: To start with any ML project we need data which is pre-processed and can be fed into the network.\n",
    "2. **Task**: There are many tasks present in ML, we need to make sure we understand and define the problem statement accurately.\n",
    "3. **Model**: We need to build our model, which is neither too deep or complex, thereby taking a lot of computational power or too small that it could not learn the important features.\n",
    "4. **Loss**: Out of the many _loss functions_ present, we need to carefully choose a _loss function_ which is suitable for the task we are about to carry out.\n",
    "5. **Learning**: As we mentioned in our last notebook, there are a variety of _optimisers_ each with their advantages and disadvantages. So here we choose an _optimiser_ which is suitable for our task and train our model using the set hyperparameters.\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: This is a crucial step in the process to determine if our model has learnt the features properly by analysing how it performs when unseen data is given to it."

    "\n",
    "##### Multi-Class Cross-Entropy loss : \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we understand how the loss value is calculated, let us understand how the outputs are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train our model , we convert all the categories to a array of 1's and 0's. Let us assume we have a model to predict if a given image is a cat or a dog, we will then start labelling all the outputs in our dataset and assign `cat = [ 1 , 0 ]` and `dog = [ 0 , 1 ] ` and we will then train our model based on it, our model will then predict the probabilities of the output of what it thinks it to be, let's say we give it an image of a cat, we get the output to be `[ 0.87 , 0.13]` which implies that the model is 87% confident that it is a cat,but this is still not good enough we then calculate the error in this case with the following equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Loss = J(w) = - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\left[ y_n \\log{\\hat{y_n}} + (1 - y_n) \\log{(1-\\hat{y_n})}  \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So ,if we try calculating the loss in our case from the equation , we will try calculating loss value for different values \n",
    "\n",
    "$ Loss = - \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\log{0.87} + (1 - 0) \\log{(1 - 0.13)} \\right] = -1 * \\log{0.87} = 0.060 $\n",
    "\n",
    "If our model trained over time and if the output would be `[ 0.90 , 0.10 ]` , then let's calculate our loss again.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Loss = - \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\log{0.90} + (1 - 0) \\log{(1 - 0.10)} \\right] = -1 * \\log{0.90} = 0.045 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So ,now we notice our loss value to have reduced , so using these equations our model learns to understand how it performs and updates the weights to perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer : \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we will be using SGD Optimizer ( Stochastic Gradient Descent ) Optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gradient Descent : \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get an insight to understand how gradient descent works :\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the top of the mountain, we take our first step downhill in the direction specified by the negative gradient. Next, we recalculate the negative gradient (passing in the coordinates of our new point) and take another step in the direction it specifies. We continue this process iteratively until we get to the bottom of our graph, or to a point where we can no longer move downhillâ€“a local minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "GD runs through all the samples in training set to do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration. In SGD, on the other hand, you use only one or subset of training sample from your training set to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using SGD will be faster because only one training sample is used and it starts improving itself right away from the first sample.\n",
