    "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are widely used in the field of image classification, object detection, and facial recognition because they are very effective in reducing the number of parameters without sacrificing on the quality of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now understand what makes up a CNN architecture and how it works. Here is an example of a CNN architecture for a classification task:\n",

    "\n",
    "Each input image will be passed through a series of convolution layers with filters (kernels), pooling layers, fully connected layers, and finally a softmax function will be applied to classify an object with probabilistic values between 0 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolution Layer \n",
    "- Strides and Padding \n",
    "- Pooling Layer\n",
    "- Fully Connected Layer \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution Layer: \n",
    "\n",
    "A convolution layer learns features from the input by preserving the relationships between neighbouring pixels, and is typically the first layer in the network. The kernel size is a hyperparameter and can be altered according to the complexity of the problem. Let's see how a kernel operates on input data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt_text](images/conv.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Source: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this definition of a convolution operation, let us now see how a convolution layer is applied in the context of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt_text](images/conv_depth.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "Defining the terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hin: Height dimension of the input layer\n",
    "- Win: Width dimension of the input layer\n",
    "- Din: Depth of the input layer\n",
    "- h: Height of the kernel\n",
    "- w: Width of the kernel\n",
    "- Dout: Number of kernels/filters to apply (and number of output channels) \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The depth of the input layer (Din) needs to match the depth of each kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Din and Dout are also called the number of channels in the layer. We can notice from the introductory image that typically the number of channels increases as we go deeper into the network, while the height and width keep decrease. This is done so that the filters aggregate features from the previous layers."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "#### Strides and Padding \n",
    "\n",
    "The stride is the number of pixels shifted over the input matrix during convolution. When the stride is 1, we move the filters 1 pixel at a time. When the stride is 2, we move the filters 2 pixels at a time, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes filters do not fit perfectly on the input image. So, we have two options:\n",
    "- Pad the picture with zeros (zero-padding) so that it fits\n",
    "- Drop the part of the image where the filter did not fit. This is called valid padding which keeps only the valid part of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers reduce the number of parameters when the images are too large. Spatial pooling, also called subsampling or downsampling, reduces the dimensionality of each layer but retains important information. Spatial pooling can be of different types:\n",
    "- Max Pooling\n",
    "    - Take the largest element from the input data.\n",
    "- Average Pooling\n",
    "    - Take the average of the elements from the input data.\n",
    "- Sum Pooling\n",
    "    - Sum of all elements in the input data.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Source: https://www.programmersought.com/article/47163598855/*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then flatten the output from the convolution layers and feed into it a _fully connected layer_ to generate a prediction. The fully connected layer is a model whose inputs are the features of the inputs obtained from the convolution layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fully connected layers are then trained along with the _kernels_ during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transposed Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply our convolution operation over an image, we find that the number of channels increases while the height and width of the image decrease. In some cases (for different applications) we will need to up-sample our images. _Transposed convolution_ helps to up-sample the images from neural network layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tranposed convolution can also be visualised as convolution of a layer with 2x2 padding (as seen on the right).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are CNNs good for image related tasks? \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1970, **David Marr** wrote a paper called [Vision](http://lolita.unice.fr/~scheer/cogsci/Marr%2082%20-%20Vision.pdf). It was a breakthrough in understanding how the brain does vision: he stated that the vision task is performed in a hierarchical manner. You start simple and get complex. For example, you start with something as simple as identifying edges and colours and then build upon them to detect the object and then classify them and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of CNNs is designed as such to emulate the human brain's technique to deal with images. As convolutions are mainly used for extracting high-level features from the images such as edges/other patterns, these algorithms try to emulate our understanding of vision. Certain filters do operations such as blurring the image, sharpening the image and then performing pooling operations on each of these filters to extract information from an image. As stated earlier, our understanding of vision indicates that vision is a hierarchical process, and our brain deals with vision in a similar fashion. CNNs also deal with understanding and classifying images similarly, thereby making them the appropriate choice for these kinds of tasks."

    "\n",
    "```tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='valid', activation=None, input_shape)```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us briefly define the parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filters`: The dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).\n",
    "- `kernel_size`: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers, specifying the height and width of the 2D convolution window. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions.\n",
    "- `padding`: One of \"valid\" or \"same\" (case-insensitive).\n",
    "- `activation`: Activation function to use (see activations). If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied (i.e. \"linear\" activation: a(x) = x).\n",

    "#### Dropout \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is an approach to regularization in neural networks which helps reduce interdependent learning amongst the neurons.\n",
    "\n",
