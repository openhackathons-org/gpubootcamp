    "# Residual Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered that learning in a convolutional neural network is hierarchical: each increase in the number of layers results in more complex features being learned by the layers. But despite this, it is shown empirically that there is a maximum threshold for depth with a traditional CNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a paper titled [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) researchers from Microsoft pointed out the following:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/resnet.PNG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The failure of the 56-layer CNN could be blamed on the optimization function, initialization of the network, or the famous vanishing/exploding gradient problem. Vanishing gradients are exceptionally easy to blame for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the **vanishing gradient** problem? When we do backpropagation, the gradients tend to get smaller and smaller as we keep on moving backwards in the network. This means that the neurons in the earlier layers learn very slowly as compared to the neurons in the later layers in the hierarchy. The earlier layers in the network are slowest to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier layers in the network are essential because they are responsible for learning and detecting the simple patterns and are actually the building blocks of our network. If they give improper and inaccurate results, we can't expect the next layers and the complete network to perform nicely and produce accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of training very deep networks has been alleviated with the introduction of a new neural network layer — the residual block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional - The Degradation Problem** \n",
    "\n",
    "The degradation problem suggests that solvers might have difficulties in approximating identity mappings by multiple nonlinear layers without the residual learning reformulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider network A having $n$ layers and network B having $m$ layers. Supposing that $n > m$, if network A performs poorly relative to network B, one might argue that if network A had mapped an identity function for the first $(n-m)$ layers, then it would have performed on par with network B. But it doesn't do that due to the vanishing gradient problem, so when we use residual networks, the network gets the input along with learning on the residual, and if the input function was appropriate, it could quickly change the weights of the residual function to be zero."

    "# Residual Blocks \n",
    "\n",
    "In a residual block the activation of a layer is fast-forwarded to a deeper layer in the neural network. Residual blocks help in the flow of information from the initial layers to the final layers. This is done by the introduction of skip connections, as seen in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let us consider $H(x)$  as an underlying mapping to be fit by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net), with $x$ denoting the inputs to the first of these layers. If one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions, then it is equivalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions, i.e., $H(x) − x$ (assuming that the input and output are of the same dimensions).*\n",
    "\n",
    "So rather than expecting the stacked layers to approximate $H(x)$, we explicitly let these layers approximate a residual function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$F(x) = H(x) − x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The original function thus becomes $F(x)+x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Although both models should be able to approximate the desired functions asymptotically, the ease of learning might be different. This reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive phenomena about the degradation problem. As we discussed above, if the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should have training error no greater than its shallow counterpart.*\n",
