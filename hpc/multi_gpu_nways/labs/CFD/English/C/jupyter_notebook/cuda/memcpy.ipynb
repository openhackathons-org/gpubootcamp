    "# Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the goal is to:\n",
    "* Parallelize the single-GPU code using CUDA Memcpy and streams\n",
    "* Understand intra-node topology and underlying technologies like GPUDirect P2P and their implication on program performance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multi-GPU Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we first cover the principle behind decomposing data among the GPUs, known as domain decomposition. Then, we understand and implement the baseline multi-GPU code using `cudaSetDevice` and `cudaMemcpy` functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we define two important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latency:** The amount of time it takes to take a unit of data from point A to point B. For example, if 4B of data can be transferred from point A to B in 4 $\\mu$s, that is the latency of transfer.\n",
    "* **Bandwidth:** The amount of data that can be transferred from point A to point B in a unit of time. For example, if the width of the bus is 64KB and latency of transfer between point A and B is 4 $\\mu$s, the bandwidth is 64KB * (1/4$\\mu$s) = 1.6 GB/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "To parallelize our application to multi-GPUs, we first review the different methods of domain decomposition available to us for splitting the data among the GPUs, thereby distributing the work. Broadly, we can divide data into either stripes or tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stripes**: They minimize the number of neighbours, require communication among less neighbours, and are optimal for latency bound communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tiles**: They minimize surface area/ volume ratio of the grid, require communicating less data, and are optimal for bandwidth bound communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "![domain_decomposition](../../images/domain_decomposition.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we divide the global grid between GPUs, only the boundaries of each GPU-local grid need to be communicated with the neighboring GPUs, as they need the updated grid-point values for the next iteration. Therefore, we use horizontal stripes (as C/ C++ are row-major) in our tutorials for domain decomposition, enabling data parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Halo Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "We term the exchange of top and bottom rows after each iterations the \"halo exchange\". Review the image below and notice that we update the topmost and bottomost rows of the grid to implement the periodic boundary condition. Recall that the left and right columns of the grid constitute Dirichlet boundary conditions (that is, constant value).\n",
    "\n",

    "## CUDA concepts: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that our system has multiple GPUs in each node, run the command below:"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [],

    "`nvidia-smi` utility shows the available GPU on a node, but inside a CUDA program, the number of GPU in the node can be obtained using the `cudaGetDeviceCount(int *count)` function. To perform any task, like running a CUDA kernel, copy operation, etc. on a particular GPU, we use the `cudaSetDevice(int device)` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying between GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cudaMemcpy` function supports GPU to GPU copy using the `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice` flag and the source and destination memory addresses should reside in GPU devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to copy 1000 floats from the array `arr_gpu_0` allocated on GPU 0 to the array `arr_gpu_1`, the function call is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "cudaMemcpy(arr_gpu_1, arr_gpu_0, 1000 * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that CUDA kernel calls made from the host are non-blocking (asynchronous) by default. That is, the control may return back to the host thread before the device kernel finishes execution. To perform the halo exchange, we need to perform copy operations between each GPU and its neighbours. However, for large copy sizes, `cudaMemcpy` is blocking with respect to the host. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we cannot use the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n",
    "    // Set current device\n",
    "    cudaSetDevice(i);\n",
    "    // Define row number of top and bottom neighbours, etc.\n",
    "    TopNeighbour = ...; BotNeighbour = ...; // and so-on\n",
    "    // Launch device kernel on GPU i\n",
    "    jacobi_kernel<<<dim_grid, dim_block>>>(...);\n",
    "    // Halo exchange\n",
    "    cudaMemcpy(grid_rows[TopNeighbour], grid_rows[myTop], size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n",
    "    cudaMemcpy(grid_rows[BotNeighbour], grid_rows[myBot], size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n",
    "    // Norm check, swapping current and previous grid arrays, etc.\n",
    "} // Serializes operations with respect to the host\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code results in serialized execution as shown in diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![memcpy_serialized](../../images/memcpy_serialized.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of `cudaMemcpy`, we can use the `cudaMemcpyAsync` function which is asynchronous with respect to the host. This allows the host to launch device kernels and copy operations concurrently, enabling parallel execution across GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The correct code snippet is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n",
    "    // Set current device\n",
    "    cudaSetDevice(i);\n",
    "    // Launch device kernel on GPU i\n",
    "    jacobi_kernel<<<dim_grid, dim_block>>>(...);\n",
    "}\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n",
    "    // Define row number of top and bottom neighbours, etc.\n",
    "    TopNeighbour = ...; BotNeighbour = ...; // and so-on\n",
    "    // Halo exchange, notice the use of Async function\n",
    "    cudaMemcpyAsync(grid_rows[TopNeighbour], grid_rows[myTop], size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n",
    "    cudaMemcpyAsync(grid_rows[BotNeighbour], grid_rows[myBot], size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n",
    "    // Norm check, swapping current and previous grid arrays, etc.\n",
    "} // Parallel execution across multiple GPUs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the execution time of the application is reduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "![memcpyasync_parallel](../../images/memcpyasync_parallel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation exercise: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's parallelize our code across multiple GPUs by using `cudaSetDevice` and `cudaMemcpyAsync` operations. Open the [jacobi_memcpy.cu](../../source_code/cuda/jacobi_memcpy.cu) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can navigate to `CFD/English/C/source_code/cuda/` directory in Jupyter's file browser in the left pane. Then, click to open the `jacobi_memcpy.cu` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the flow of the program from within the `main` function. Review the following pre-Jacobi-computation steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computation of the memory chunk size to be allocated on each GPU stored in the `chunk_size` integer array.\n",
    "2. Allocation of memory on each GPU: Notice the use of array pointers like `a_new`, `l2_norm_d`, `iy_start`, etc. that point to device arrays allocated on GPU pointed to by `dev_id` variable.\n",
    "3. Initialization of Dirichlet boundary conditions on left and right boundaries.\n",
    "4. Share of initial top and bottom local grid-point values between neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, within the iterative Jacobi loop (the `while` loop), implement the following marked as `TODO: Part 1-`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set current GPU and call device kernel with correct device arrays in function arguments.\n",
    "2. Asynchronously copy GPU-local L2 norm back to CPU and implement top and bottom halo exchanges.\n",
    "3. Synchronize the devices at the end of each iteration using `cudaDeviceSynchronize` function.\n",
