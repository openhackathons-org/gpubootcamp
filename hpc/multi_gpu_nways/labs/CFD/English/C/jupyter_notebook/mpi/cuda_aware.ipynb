    "* CUDA-aware MPI concepts and APIs.\n",
    "* Impact of fine-tuning CUDA-aware MPI on application performance.\n",
    "* Underlying GPUDirect technologies like P2P and RDMA.\n",

    "# Improving Application Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have passed host (system) memory pointers to the MPI calls. With a regular MPI implementation only pointers to host memory can be passed to MPI. However, if we combine MPI and CUDA, we need to send (and receive) GPU buffers instead of host buffers. Thus, using regular MPI, we need to stage GPU buffers through host memory explicitly using `cudaMemcpy` as we saw in the previous lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in previous lab, initially MPI calls take a lot of time and they gradually improve in latency and throughput. It is therefore helpful to zoom out of a particular Jacobi iteration and look at the bigger picture, that is, the average time taken for a halo exchange. Recall that with the `--stats=true` flag, stats are visible on the terminal as well. In particular, observe the NVTX Push-Pop stats:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mpi_memcpy_nvtx_stats](../../images/mpi_memcpy_nvtx_stats.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum, maximum and average time taken for single halo exchange, including software overhead, is visible. The average time is $84\\mu$s, minimum is $50\\mu$s, and maximum is $6382\\mu$s. The average time taken is a useful statistic for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also view the throughput and latency of HtoD and DtoH copy operations as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mpi_host_staging_throughput_latency](../../images/mpi_host_staging_throughput_latency.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opportunity for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "There is considerable software overhead of using multiple Memcpy operations with the MPI call. Moreover, the HtoD and DtoH throughput/ latency are worse compared to DtoD because PCIe is used for CPU-GPU communication and NVLinks are not utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regular MPI, we can try to write a program where intra-node communication is handled in a single process and then we can enable P2P and other optimizations that we learnt in previous labs. We will also need a separate inter-node communication code. This is a complex and time-consuming approach and will not scale well espcially with more communication intensive programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need to make use of CUDA-aware MPI which simplifies the code substantially and enables many optimizations under the hood transparently to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CUDA-aware MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "With CUDA-aware MPI, the GPU buffers can be passed directly to MPI. A CUDA-aware MPI implementation handles buffers differently depending on whether it resides in host or device memory. With the Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA) feature, the host memory and the memory of all GPUs in a system (a single node) are combined into one large (virtual) address space. The function is then able to infer from the memory pointer as to whether it resides on host or on the device and handles the operations accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an API standpoint, CUDA-aware MPI results in simplified codes where CUDA memory pointers can seamlessly be used in MPI calls. Without CUDA-aware MPI, we need to stage GPU buffers through host memory buffers (`s_buf_h`, `r_buf_h`), using `cudaMemcpy` as shown in the following code excerpt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "//MPI rank 0\n",
    "cudaMemcpy(s_buf_h, s_buf_d, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n",
    "MPI_Send(s_buf_h, size, MPI_CHAR, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n",
    "\n",
    "//MPI rank 1\n",
    "MPI_Recv(r_buf_h, size, MPI_CHAR, 0, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status);\n",
    "cudaMemcpy(r_buf_d, r_buf_h, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a CUDA-aware MPI library this is not necessary; the GPU buffers (`s_buf_d`, `r_buf_d`) can be directly passed to MPI as in the following excerpt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "//MPI rank 0\n",
    "MPI_Send(s_buf_d, size, MPI_CHAR, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n",
    "\n",
    "//MPI rank n-1\n",
    "MPI_Recv(r_buf_d, size, MPI_CHAR, 0, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the implementation is quite intuitive and easy-to-use. Now, let us use CUDA-aware MPI in our application.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Rank 0 is used to calculate efficiency and other metrics, even though all ranks compute `single_gpu` function to verify multi-GPU implementation's correctness.\n",
