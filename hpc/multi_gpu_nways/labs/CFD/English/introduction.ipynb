    "\n",
    "Scaling applications to multiple GPUs across multiple nodes requires one to be adept at not just the programming models and optimization techniques, but also at performing root-cause analysis using in-depth profiling to identify and minimize bottlenecks. In this bootcamp, participants will learn to improve the performance of an application step-by-step, taking cues from profilers along the way. Moreover, understanding of the underlying technologies and communication topology will help us utilize high-performance NVIDIA libraries to extract more performance out of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this bootcamp session, participants will be adept at:\n",
    "* Reviewing communication architecture and topology\n",
    "* Developing CUDA-aware multi-node multi-GPU MPI applications\n",
    "* Profiling the application using NVIDIA Nsight Systems\n",
    "* Applying optimizations like CUDA streams, events, and overlapping compute and communication\n",
    "* Understanding GPUDirect technologies like P2P and RDMA\n",
    "* Learning to use NVIDIA NCCL and NVSHMEM libraries\n",

    "### Content Level\n",
    "Intermediate, Advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience and Prerequisites\n",
    "The target audience for this lab are researchers, graduate students, and developers who are interested in scaling their scientific applications to multiple nodes using multi-GPU implmenetations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience in C/ C++ and basic CUDA programming is required. Experience with parallel programming frameworks like OpenMP or MPI is not required but a basic understanding of MPI is highly recommended.\n",
