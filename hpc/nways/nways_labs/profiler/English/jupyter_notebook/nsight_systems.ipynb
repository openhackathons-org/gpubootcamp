    "### What is profiling\n",
    "Profiling is the first step in optimizing and tuning your application. Profiling an application would help us understand where most of the execution time is spent. You will gain an understanding of its performance characteristics and can easily identify parts of the code that present opportunities for improvement. Finding hotspots and bottlenecks in your application, can help you decide where to focus our optimization efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVIDIA Nsight Tools\n",
    "NVIDIA offers Nsight tools (Nsight Systems, Nsight Compute, Nsight Graphics), a collection of applications which enable developers to debug, profile the performance of CUDA, OpenACC, or OpenMP applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your profiling workflow will change to reflect the individual Nsight tools. Start with Nsight Systems to get a system-level overview of the workload and eliminate any system level bottlenecks, such as unnecessary thread synchronization or data movement, and improve the system level parallelism of your algorithms. Once you have done that, then proceed to Nsight Compute or Nsight Graphics to optimize the most significant CUDA kernels or graphics workloads, respectively. Periodically return to Nsight Systems to ensure that you remain focused on the largest bottleneck. Otherwise the bottleneck may have shifted and your kernel level optimizations may not achieve as high of an improvement as expected.\n",

    "`nsys profile -t openacc,nvtx --stats=true --force-overwrite true -o laplace ./laplace`\n",

    "- `profile` – start a profiling session\n",
    "- `-t`: Selects the APIs to be traced (nvtx and openacc in this example)\n",
    "- `--stats`: if true, it generates summary of statistics after the collection\n",
    "- `--force-overwrite`e: if true, it overwrites the existing generated report\n",
    "- `-o` – name for the intermediate result file, created at the end of the collection (.qdrep filename)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You do not need to memorize the profiler options. You can always run `nsys --help` or `nsys [specific command] --help` from the command line and use the necessary options or profiler arguments.\n",

If you would like to view this on your local machine, this requires that the local system has CUDA toolkit installed of same version and the Nsight System GUI version should match the CLI version. More details on where to download CUDA toolkit can be found in the “Links and Resources” at the end of this page.\n",

    "NVIDIA Tools Extension (NVTX) is a C-based Application Programming Interface (API) for annotating events, time ranges and resources in applications. NVTX brings the profiled application’s logic into the Profiler, making the Profiler’s displayed data easier to analyse and enables correlating the displayed data to profiled application’s actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During this lab, we profile the application using Nsight Systems command line interface and collect the timeline. We will also be tracing NVTX APIs (already integrated into the application). The NVTX tool is a powerful mechanism that allows users to manually instrument their application. NVIDIA Nsight Systems can then collect the information and present it on the timeline. It is particularly useful for tracing of CPU events and time ranges and greatly improves the timeline's readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use NVTX**: Add `#include \"nvtx3/nvToolsExt.h\"` in your source code and wrap parts of your code which you want to capture events with calls to the NVTX API functions. For example, try adding `nvtxRangePush(\"main\")` in the beginning of your `main()` function, and `nvtxRangePop(`) just before the return statement in the end.\n",
