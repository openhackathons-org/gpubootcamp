    "# Introduction\n",
    "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were initially designed to accelerate graphics processing, but in 2007 the release of CUDA introduced GPUs as General Purpose Processors. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes using a GPU for general purpose computing simple and elegant. The developer still programs in the familiar C, C++, Fortran, or an ever expanding list of supported languages, and incorporates extensions of these languages in the form of a few basic keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA C/C++ is:\n",
    "- Based on a standard C/C++\n",
    "- A small set of extensions to enable heterogeneous programming\n",
    "- A straightforward API to manage devices, memory, etc.\n",

    "# CUDA \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heterogeneous Computing:** CUDA is a heterogeneous programming model that includes provisions for both a CPU and GPU. The CUDA C/C++ programming interface consists of C language extensions so that you can target portions of source code for parallel execution on the device (GPU). It is based on a standard C/C++ and provides a library of C functions that can be\n",
    "executed on the host (CPU) so that it can interact with the device. The two processor that work with each other are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Host: CPU and its memory (Host Memory)\n",
    "- Device: GPU and its memory  (Device Memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at a Hello World! CUDA C code\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "_global__ void print_from_gpu(void) {\n",
    "    printf(\"Hello World! from thread [%d,%d] From device\\n\", threadIdx.x,blockIdx.x);\n",

    "So you might have already observed that CUDA C is nothing but extensions/constructs to existing language. Let us look at what those additional constructs we introduced above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```__global__``` :This keyword, when added before the function, tells the compiler that this is a function that will run on the device and not on the host. \n",
    "- ``` <<<,>>> ``` : This keyword tells the compiler that this is a call to the device function and not the host function. Additionally, the 1,1 parameter basically dictates the number of threads to launch in the kernel. We will cover the parameters inside angle brackets later. \n",
    "- ``` threadIdx.x, blockIdx.x ``` : This is a unique ID that's given to all threads. \n",
    "- ``` cudaDeviceSynchronize() ``` : All of the kernel(Function that runs on GPU) calls in CUDA are asynchronous in nature. This API will make sure that host does not proceed until all device calls are over.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will get into the concept of _blocks_ and _threads_ in upcoming section. But let us first look at steps involved in writing CUDA code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in CUDA Programming\n",

    "| Sequential code | CUDA Code |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Step 1** Allocate memory on the CPU ( _malloc new_ ) | **Step 1** : Allocate memory on the CPU (_malloc, new_ )|\n",
    "| **Step 2** Populate/initialize the CPU data | **Step 2** Allocate memory on the GPU, using API like _cudaMalloc()_ |\n",

    "| | **Step 6** Synchronize the device and host with _cudaDeviceSynchronize()_ |\n",
    "| | **Step 7** Transfer data from the device to the host with _cudaMemcpy()_ |\n",
    "| | **Step 8** Consume the crunched data on Host |\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU and GPU memory are different and developer needs to use additional CUDA API to allocate and free memory on GPU. Only device memory can be consumed inside GPU function call (kernel). Linear memory on Device is typically allocated using ```cudaMalloc()``` and freed using ```cudaFree()``` and data transfer between host memory and device memory are typically done using ```cudaMemcpy()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The API definition of these are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "**cudaError_t cudaMalloc (void ∗∗ devPtr, size_t size)** Allocates size bytes of linear memory on the device and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The allocated memory is suitably aligned for any kind of variable. cudaMalloc() returns ```cudaErrorMemoryAllocation``` in case of failure or ```cudaSuccess```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**cudaError_t cudaMemcpy (void ∗ dst, const void ∗ src, size_t count, enum cudaMemcpyKind kind)** Copies count bytes from the memory area pointed to by src to the memory area pointed to by dst, where kind is one of ```cudaMemcpyHostToHost```, ```cudaMemcpyHostToDevice```, ```cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost```, or ```cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice```, and specifies the direction of the copy. Calling cudaMemcpy() with dst and src pointers that do not match the direction of the copy results in an undefined behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**cudaError_t cudaFree (void ∗ devPtr)** Frees the memory space pointed to by devPtr, which must have been returned by a previous call to cudaMalloc() or other equivalent API. \n",

To allocate data in unified memory, we call `cudaMallocManaged()`, which returns a pointer that you can access from host (CPU) code or device (GPU) code. To free the data, just pass the pointer to `cudaFree()`.

    "# A Quick Recap\n",
    "We saw the definition of CUDA and CUDA C. We covered briefly CUDA architecture and introduced CUDA C constructs. Also we played with block and thread configurations for a simple vector addition code. All this was done under the following restrictions:\n",
    "1. **Multiple Dimension**: We launched threads and blocks in one dimension. We have been using _threadIdx.x_ and _blockIdx.x_, so what is _.x_ ? THis statement basically says that we are launching threads and blocks in one dimension only. CUDA allows to launch threads in 3 dimensions. You can also have _.y_ and _.z_ for index calculation. For example you can launch threads and blocks in 2 dimensions for dividing work for a 2D image. Also the maximum number of threads per block and number of blocks allowed per dimension is restricted based on the GPU that the code is run on.\n",
    "2. **GPU Memory**: What we have not covered is that GPU has different hierarchy of memory, e.g. GPU has a read only memory which provides high bandwidth for 2D and 3D locality access called _texture_. Also GPU provides a scratch pad limited memory called as _shared memory_\n",
    "3. **Optimization** : What we did not cover so far is the right way to access the compute and memory to get max performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**One key characteristic about CUDA is that a user can control access pattern of data for each thread. The user can decide which part of memory the data can sits on. While we are covering some part of this in this lab, which is required for us to port our code, we do not intend to cover all optimizations**"
