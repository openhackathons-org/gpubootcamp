    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "The **goal** of this lab is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to run the same code on both a multicore CPU and a GPU using the OpenMP Target programming model\n",
    "- Understand the key directives and steps involved in making a sequential code parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not intend to cover:\n",
    "- Optimization techniques in details\n",

    "# OpenMP Directives\n",
    "- OpenMP has been formed in 1997 to focus on vendor-neutral Shared Memory Parallelism.\n",
    "- OpenMP 4.0 in 2013 expanded its focus beyond shared memory parallel computers including accelerators. \n",
    "- The OpenMP 4.0 target construct provides the means to offload data and computation to accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like OpenACC, OpenMP is directive based. Compiler directives appear as comments in your source code and are ignored by compilers unless you tell them otherwise - usually by specifying the appropriate compiler flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be using the OpenMP target construct to offload data and computation to GPU. Multiple compilers are in development to support OpenMP offloading to NVIDIA GPUs. We will using NVIDIA HPC SDK compiler for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenMP Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```#pragma omp directive ``` \n",
    "\n",
    "**#pragma** in C/C++ is what's known as a \"compiler hint.\" These are very similar to programmer comments, however, the compiler will actually read our pragmas. Pragmas are a way for the programmer to \"guide\" the compiler, without running the chance damaging the code. If the compiler does not understand the pragma, it can ignore it, rather than throw a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**omp** is an addition to our pragma, it is known as the “sentinel”. It specifies that this is an OpenMP pragma. Any non-OpenMP compiler will ignore this pragma. \n",
    "\n",
    "**directives** are commands in OpenMP that will tell the compiler to do some action. For now, we will only use directives that allow the compiler to parallelize our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners who are new to OpenMP directive, we will be introducing some terminologies and concepts before starting to add ```target``` directives to our code to offload onto GPU computation and data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenMP Fork-Join Model\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP uses the fork-join model of parallel execution. All OpenMP programs begin as a single process: the master thread. The master thread executes sequentially until the first parallel region construct is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FORK**: the master thread then creates a team of parallel threads.The statements in the program that are enclosed by the parallel region construct are then executed in parallel among the various team threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JOIN**: When the team threads complete the statements in the parallel region construct, they synchronize and terminate, leaving only the master thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/openmp_fork_join.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenMP Parallel Region\n",
    "\n",
    "A parallel region is a block of code that will be executed by multiple threads. This is the fundamental OpenMP parallel construct. When a thread reaches a PARALLEL directive, it creates a team of threads and becomes the master of the team. The master is a member of that team. Starting from the beginning of this parallel region, the code is duplicated and all threads will execute that code redundantly.There is an implied barrier at the end of a parallel region. Only the master thread continues execution past this point\n",

    "```target``` construct consists of a target directive and an execution region. ```target``` directive define a target region, which is a block of computation that operates within a distinct data environment and is intended to be offloaded onto a parallel computation device during execution ( GPU in our case). Data used within the region may be implicitly or explicitly mapped to the device. All of OpenMP is allowed within target regions, but only a subset will run well on GPUs.\n",

    "            ANew[j] = A [j-1] + A[j+1];\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    iter++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  ```target data``` to explicitly map the data\n",

    "- from (list)\n",
    "    - Allocates memory on the device and copies the data to the host when exiting the region\n",
    "- alloc (list)\n",
    "    - Allocates memory on the device. If the data is already present on the device a reference counter is incremented\n",

    "### ```teams``` directive\n",
    "```teams``` directve creates a league of thread teams where the master thread of each team executes the region. Each of these master threads executes sequentially. Or in other words teams directive spawn 1 or more thread teams with the same number of threads. The execution continues on the master threads of each team (redundantly). There is no synchronization allowed between teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP calls that somewhere a team, which might be a thread on the CPU or maying a CUDA threadblock or OpenCL workgroup. It will choose how many teams to create based on where you're running, only a few on a CPU (like 1 per CPU core) or lots on a GPU (1000's possibly). ```teams``` allow OpenMP code to scale from small CPUs to large GPUs because each one works completely independently of each other ```teams```.\n",

    "There's a good chance that we don't want the loop to be run redundantly in every master thread of ```teams``` though, that seems wasteful and potentially dangerous. With usage of ```distribute``` construct the iterations of the next loop are broken into groups that are “distributed” to the master threads of the teams. The iterations are distributed statically and there’s no guarantees about the order teams will execute. Also it does not generate parallelism/worksharing within the thread teams.\n",

To solve this problem we will make use of work-sharing as we did before.
