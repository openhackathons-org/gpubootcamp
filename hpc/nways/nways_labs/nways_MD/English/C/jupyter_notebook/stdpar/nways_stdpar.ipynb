    "# STL\n",
    "If you are not familiar with STL (Standard Template Library), this section will give you a brief introduction that would be required to understand the usage of STL library for our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the C++ Standard Template Library are following three well-structured components \n",
    "\n",
    "- Containers: Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind. There are several different types of containers like dequeue, list, vector, map etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms: Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means by which you will perform initialization, sorting, searching, and transforming of the contents of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterators: Iterators are used to step through the elements of collections of objects. These collections may be containers or subsets of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our code to make *Pair Calculation* we will be making use of ```vector``` container. The example below will introduce you to the container and how to use iterator to step through elements of vector. ```vector``` container (a C++ Standard Template) which is similar to an array with an exception that it automatically handles its own storage requirements in case it grows\n",
    "\n",
    "For our code we will be making use of ```std::for_each``` algorithm and its sample usage is also shown in code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <vector>\n",

    "#include <iostream>\n",
    " \n",
    "//Using functor\n",
    "struct Sum\n",

    "# Parallel STL\n",
    "Starting with C++17, parallelism has become an integral part of the standard itself. Parallel STL is an implementation of the C++ standard library algorithms with support for execution policies, commonly called C++17.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++17 Parallel Standard Library (stdpar) introduces parallel and vector concurrency for standard algorithms. It is important to note that stdpar is a library and not a language extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## std::par Execution Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Policies define the kind of parallelism that will be applied to parallel algorithms. Most standard algorithms included in STL support execution policies. Defined below are the execution policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- std::execution::seq = sequential\n",
    "    - This execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel algorithm overloading and require that a parallel algorithm’s execution may not be parallelized.\n",
    "- std::execution::par = parallel\n",
    "    - This execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel algorithm overloading and indicate that a parallel algorithm’s execution may be parallelized\n",
    "- std::execution::par_unseq = parallel + vectorized\n",
    "    - This execution policy type used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel algorithm overloading and indicate that a parallel algorithm’s execution may be parallelized and vectorized\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of execution policies is provided by different compilers from specific vendors. For GPU parallel execution policy we will be making use of NVIDIA compiler. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to how the call to _stl_ algorithms changed the new version of C++ standard to incorporate execution policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**C++98:** \n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "std::sort(c.begin(), c.end()); \n",
    "```\n",
    "**C++17:** \n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "std::sort(std::execution::par, c.begin(), c.end());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the NVIDIA HPC C++ compiler, NVC++. It supports C++17, C++ Standard Parallelism (stdpar) for NVIDIA GPUs, OpenACC for multicore CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, and OpenMP for multicore CPUs. No language extensions or non-standard libraries are required to enable GPU acceleration. All data movement between host memory and GPU device memory is performed implicitly and automatically under the control of CUDA [Unified Memory](../GPU_Architecture_Terminologies.ipynb), which means that heap memory is automatically shared between a CPU(Host) and GPU(Device). Stack memory and global memory are not shared. Below given example shows the right allocation and usage of the stdpar.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "std::vector<int> v = ...;\n",
    "std::sort(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end()); // OK, vector allocates on heap\n",
    "\n",
    "std::array<int, 1024> a = ...;\n",
    "std::sort(std::execution::par, a.begin(), a.end()); // Fails, array stored on the stack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For our code we will be making use of ```std::for_each``` algorithm with support for ```std::execution::par``` execution policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counting Iterator**: In our code we will also be using a special iterator ```counting_iterator```. This iterator which represents a pointer into a range of sequentially changing values. This iterator is useful for creating a range filled with a sequence without explicitly storing it in memory. Using ```counting_iterator``` saves memory capacity and bandwidth"
