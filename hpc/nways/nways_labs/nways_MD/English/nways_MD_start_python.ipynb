    "With the release of CUDA in 2007, different approaches to programming GPUs have evolved. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. By the end of this bootcamp session, students will have a broader perspective on GPU programming approaches to help them select a programming model that better fits their applications' needs and constraints. The bootcamp will teach how to accelerate a popular algorithm of Radial Distribution Function (RDF) using the following methods:\n",
