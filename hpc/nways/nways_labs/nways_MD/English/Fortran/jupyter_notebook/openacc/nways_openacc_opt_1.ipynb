On the other hand, the OpenACC execution model has three levels of *Vector*, *Worker* and *Gang*. *Vector* threads work in lockstep, performing a single operation on multipler data (SIMD), whereas *Workers* computes one vector and *Gangs* have 1 or more workers and they all share resources such as cache, or SMs. Gangs run independent of each other.\n",

Apply the `collapse(N)` clause to a loop directive to collapse the next `N` tightly-nested loops to be collapsed into a single, flattened loop. This is useful if you have many nested loops or when you have really short loops. Sample usage of collapse clause is given as follows:\n",
