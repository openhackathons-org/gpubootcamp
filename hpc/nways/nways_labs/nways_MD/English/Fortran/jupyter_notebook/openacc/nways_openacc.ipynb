    "# OpenACC Directives\n",
    "Using OpenACC directives will allow us to parallelize our code without explicitly alter our code. What this means is that, by using OpenACC directives, we can have a single code that will function as both a sequential code and a parallel code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenACC Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```!$acc <directive> <clauses> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**!$acc** in Fortran is what's known as a \"compiler hint.\" These are very similar to programmer comments, however, the compiler will actually read our comments. They are a way for the programmer to \"guide\" the compiler, without running the chance damaging the code. If the compiler does not understand the comment, it can ignore it, rather than throw a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**acc** specifies that this is an OpenACC related directive that will folow. Any non-OpenACC compiler will ignore this. \n",
    "\n",
    "**directives** are commands in OpenACC that will tell the compiler to do some action. For now, we will only use directives that allow the compiler to parallelize our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**clauses** are additions/alterations to our directives. These include (but are not limited to) optimizations. One way to think about it: directives describe a general action for our compiler to do (such as, paralellize our code), and clauses allow the programmer to be more specific (such as, how we specifically want the code to be parallelized).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Key Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenACC consists of 3 key types of directives responsible for **parallel execution**, **managing data movement** and **optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be covering the parallel execution directive in this lab. The data directive is part of the additional section and can be tried out in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel and Loop Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three directives we will cover in this lab: `parallel`, `loop`, and `parallel loop`. Once we understand all three of them, you will be tasked with parallelizing **Pair Calculation** with your preferred directive \n",
    "\n",
    "The parallel directive may be the most straight-forward of the directives. It will mark a region of the code for parallelization (this usually only includes parallelizing a single **for** loop.) Let's take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "!$acc parallel loop\n",
    "    do i=1,N\n",
    "        < loop code >\n",
    "    enddo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also define a \"parallel region\". The parallel region may have multiple loops (though this is often not recommended!) \n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "!$acc parallel\n",
    "    !$acc loop\n",
    "    do i=1,N\n",
    "        < loop code >\n",
    "    enddo\n",
    "!$acc end parallel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`!$acc parallel loop` will mark the next loop for parallelization. It is extremely important to include the `loop`, otherwise you will not be parallelizing the loop properly. The parallel directive tells the compiler to \"redundantly parallelize\" the code. The `loop` directive specifically tells the compiler that we want the loop parallelized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of why the loop directive is so important. The `parallel` directive tells the compiler to create somewhere to run parallel code. OpenACC calls that somewhere a `gang`, which might be a thread on the CPU or maying a CUDA threadblock or OpenCL workgroup. It will choose how many gangs to create based on where you're running, only a few on a CPU (like 1 per CPU core) or lots on a GPU (1000's possibly). Gangs allow OpenACC code to scale from small CPUs to large GPUs because each one works completely independently of each other gang. That's why there's a space between gangs in the images below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/parallel1f.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/parallel2f.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a good chance that we don't want my loop to be run redundantly in every gang though, that seems wasteful and potentially dangerous. Instead we want to instruct the compiler to break up the iterations of my loop and to run them in parallel on the gangs. To do that, we simply can add a `loop` directive to the interesting loops. This instructs the compiler that we want my loop to be parallelized and promises to the compiler that it's safe to do so. Now that we have both `parallel` and `loop`, things loop a lot better (and run a lot faster). Now the compiler is spreading my loop iterations to all of my gangs, but also running multiple iterations of the loop at the same time within each gang as a *vector*. Think of a vector like this, we have 10 numbers that I want to add to 10 other numbers (in pairs). Rather than looking up each pair of numbers, adding them together, storing the result, and then moving on to the next pair in-order, modern computer hardware allows me to add all 10 pairs together all at once, which is a lot more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/parallel3f.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The `acc parallel loop` directive is both a promise and a request to the compiler. The programmer is promising that the loop can safely be parallelized and am requesting that the compiler do so in a way that makes sense for the machine we target. The compiler may make completely different decisions if we are compiling for a multicore CPU than it would for a GPU and that's the idea. OpenACC enables programmers to parallelize their codes without having to worry about the details of how best to do so for every possible machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atomic Construct\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code you will also require one more construct which will help you in getting the right results. OpenACC atomic construct ensures that a particular variable is accessed and/or updated atomically to prevent indeterminate results and race conditions. In other words, it prevents one thread from stepping on the toes of other threads due to accessing a variable simultaneously, resulting in different results run-to-run. For example, if we want to count the number of elements that have a value greater than zero, we could write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "if(r<cut)then\n",

Just adding OpenACC to our  loop we achieved a considerable performance boost. However, managed memory is not compatible with all GPUs or all compilers and it sometimes performs worse than programmer-defined memory management. Also when programming for a GPU, based on the application type handling data management explicitly between the CPU and GPU may result into better performance.\n",
