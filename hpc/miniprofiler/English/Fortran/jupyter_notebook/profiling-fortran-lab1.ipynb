    "To plan an incremental parallelization strategy after identifying routines responsible for the bulk of the execution time, it is important to know how the application can scale. The amount of performance an application achieves by running on a GPU depends on the the extend to which it can be parallelized. Code that cannot be sufficiently parallelized should run on the host, unless doing so would result in excessive transfers between the host and the device. It is very important to understand the relation between the problem size and computational performance as this can determine the amount of speedup and benefit you would get by parallelizing on GPU.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* `nx_glob` and `nz_glob` is the number of total cells in the x and z directions\n",
    "* `sim_time` is the simulation time in seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of total cells in the x-direction must be twice as large as the total number of cells in the z directions. The default values are 40, 20, and 10 seconds.\n",
    " \n",
    "Now, we profile the code again and open the example expected output via the Nsight Systems UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the \"timeline view\", take a closer look at the \"NVTX\" markers from function table on the left side of top pane and compare it with the timeline from the previous report. You can see now that the most time consuming part of the application is the initialization. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/e1-nvtx.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the small problem size (`nx_glob`, `nz_glob` , and `sim_time` in this example), most of the computation is dominated by the initialization and there is not enough work/computation to make it suitable for GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to *Amdahl's law*, the speedup achieved by accelerating portions of an application is limited by the code sections that are not accelerated. Before parallelizing an application, it is important to know that the overall performance improvement gained by optimizing portion of the code is limited by the fraction of time that the improved section is actually used. In other words, you may speedup portion of the code by a factor of N, but if only a small fraction of time is spent in this portion of the code, then the overall performance hasn't been improved substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example, changing the problem size can hide the initialization part of the code and make it a better candidate for the GPU. Now that you have determined what the most important bottleneck is, modify the application to make this problem more appropriate for the GPU."
