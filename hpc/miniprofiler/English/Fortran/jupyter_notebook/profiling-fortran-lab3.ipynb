    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "Learn how to improve GPU occupancy and extract more parallelism by adding more descriptive clauses to the OpenACC loop constructs in the application. In this exercise you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about GPU occupancy, and  OpenACC vs CUDA execution model \n",
    "- Learn how to find out GPU occupancy from the Nsight Systems profiler\n",
    "- Learn how to improve the occupancy and saturate compute resources \n",
    "- Learn about collapse clause for further optimization of the parallel nested loops and when to use them\n",
    "- Apply collapse clause to eligible nested loops in the application and investigate the profiler report\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the profiler report from the previous exercise again. From the timeline, have a close look at the the kernel functions. We can see that the for example `compute_tendencies_z_383_gpu` kernel has the theoretical occupancy of 37.5% . It clearly shows that the occupancy is a limiting factor. *Occupancy* is a measure of how well the GPU compute resources are being utilized. It is about how much parallelism is running / how much parallelism the hardware could run.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/occu-2.png\" width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA GPUs are comprised of multiple streaming multiprocessors (SMs) where it can manage up to 2048 concurrent threads (not actively running at the same time). Low occupancy shows that there are not enough active threads to fully utilize the computing resources. Higher occupancy implies that the scheduler has more active threads to choose from and hence achieves higher performance. So, what does this mean in OpenACC execution model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gang, Worker, and Vector**\n",
    "CUDA and OpenACC programming model use different terminologies for similar ideas. For example, in CUDA, parallel execution is organized into grids, blocks, and threads. On the other hand, the OpenACC execution model has three levels of gang, worker, and vector. OpenACC assumes the device has multiple processing elements (Streaming Multiprocessors on NVIDIA GPUs) running in parallel and mapping of OpenACC execution model on CUDA is as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An OpenACC gang is a threadblock\n",
    "- A worker is a warp\n",
    "- An OpenACC vector is a CUDA thread\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/diagram.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to improve the occupancy, we have to increase the parallelism within the gang. In other words, we have to increase the number of threads that can be scheduled on the GPU to improve GPU thread occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizing loops and improving occupancy**\n",
    "Let's have a look at the compiler feedback (*Line 315*) and the corresponding code snippet showing three tightly nested loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ffeedback1-1.png\" width=\"90%\" height=\"90%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The iteration count for the outer loop is `NUM_VARS` which is 4. As you can see from the above screenshot, the block dimention is <4,1,1> which shows the small amount of parallelism within the gang.\n",

    "    !$acc parallel loop\n",
    "    do ll = 1 , NUM_VARS\n",
    "      do k = 1 , nz\n",

    "          tend(i,k,ll) = -( flux(i+1,k,ll) - flux(i,k,ll) ) / dx\n",
    "        enddo\n",
    "      enddo\n",
    "    enddo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to expose more parallelism and improve the occupancy, we can use an additional clause called `collapse` in the `!$acc parallel loop` to optimize loops. The loop directive gives the compiler additional information about the next loop in the source code through several clauses. Apply the `collapse(N)` clause to a loop directive to collapse the next `N` tightly-nested loops to be collapsed into a single, flattened loop. This is useful if you have many nested loops or when you have really short loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the loop count in any of some tightly nested loops is relatively small compared to the available number of threads in the device, creating a single iteration space across all the nested loops, increases the iteration count thus allowing the compiler to extract more parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips on where to use:**\n",
    "- Collapse outer loops to enable creating more gangs.\n",
    "- Collapse inner loops to enable longer vector lengths.\n",
    "- Collapse all loops, when possible, to do both\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, add `collapse` clause to the code and make necessary changes to the loop directives. Once done, save the file, re-compile via `make`, and profile it again. \n",
