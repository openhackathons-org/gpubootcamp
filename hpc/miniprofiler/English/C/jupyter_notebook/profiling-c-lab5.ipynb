    "Profiling is the first step in optimizing and tuning your application. Profiling an application would help us understand where most of the execution time is spent. You will gain an understanding of its performance characteristics and can easily identify parts of the code that present opportunities for improvement. Finding hotspots and bottlenecks in your application, can help you decide where to focus our optimization efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVIDIA Nsight Tools\n",
    "NVIDIA offers Nsight tools (Nsight Systems, Nsight Compute, Nsight Graphics), a collection of applications which enable developers to debug, profile the performance of CUDA, OpenACC, or OpenMP applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your profiling workflow will change to reflect the individual Nsight tools. Start with Nsight Systems to get a system-level overview of the workload and eliminate any system level bottlenecks, such as unnecessary thread synchronization or data movement, and improve the system level parallelism of your algorithms. Once you have done that, then proceed to Nsight Compute or Nsight Graphics to optimize the most significant CUDA kernels or graphics workloads, respectively. Periodically return to Nsight Systems to ensure that you remain focused on the largest bottleneck. Otherwise the bottleneck may have shifted and your kernel level optimizations may not achieve as high of an improvement as expected.\n",

    "### Introduction to Nsight Compute\n",
    "Nsight Compute tool provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool. NVIDIA Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for GPU applications which provides detailed performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and command line tool. The NVIDIA Nsight Compute CLI (`nv-nsight-cu-cli`) provides a non-interactive way to profile applications from the command line and can print the results directly on the command line or store them in a report file. Results can then be imported to the GUI version for inspection. With command line profiler, you can instrument the target API, and collect profile results for the specified kernels or all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/compute.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Navigating the report via GUI**\n",
    "The Nsight Compute UI consists of a header with general information, as well as controls to switch between report pages or individual collected kernel launches. By default, the profile report comes up on the *Details* page. You can easily switch between different report pages of the report with the dropdown labeled *Page* on the top-left of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/page-compute.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "A report can contain any number of results from kernel launches. The *Launch* dropdown allows switching between the different results in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/launch-compute.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sections and Sets**\n",
    "Nsight Compute uses section sets to decided the amount of metrics to be collected. By default, a relatively small number of metrics is collected such as SOL (speed of light – comparison against best possible behavior), launch statistics, and occupancy analysis. You can optionally select which of these sections are collected and displayed with command-line parameters. To learn more about available sections, checkout [this table](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightCompute/index.html#sections-and-rules).\n",

On the *Details* page, press the button *Add Baseline* to make the current report/result, the baseline for all other results from this report and any other report opened in the same instance of Nsight Compute. When a baseline is set, every element on the *Details* page shows two values: The current value of the result in focus and the corresponding value of the baseline or the percentage of change from the corresponding baseline value.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Profiling using command line interface \n",
    "To profile the application, you can either use the Graphical User Interface(GUI) or Command Line Interface (CLI). During this lab, we will profile the mini application using CLI. The Nsight Compute command line executable is named `nv-nsight-cu-cli`. To collect the default set of data for all kernel launches in the application, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nv-nsight-cu-cli ./miniWeather`\n",
    "\n",
    "For all kernel invocations in the application code, details page data will be gathered and displayed. Example screenshot shows major sections (highlighted in yellow) for SOL (speed of light – comparison against best possible behavior), launch statistics, and occupancy analysis for the example kernel function *set_halo_values_x_409_gpu(double*)* (annotated with red line). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cli-out.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You can optionally select which of these sections are collected and displayed with command-line parameters. Simply run `nv-nsight-cu-cli --list-sets` from the command line to see list of available sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/list-set.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To view all sections and sets when profiling your application with Nsight Compute, run `nv-nsight-cu-cli --set=full ./miniWeather`. Now, you can see Memory and Compute Workload Analysis, scheduler, warp state and instruction statistics in addition to the default sections added to the profiling report. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The choice of sections and metrics will affect profiling time and will slow down the process. It also increases the size of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also options available to specify for which kernels data should be collected. -k allows you to filter the kernels by a regex match of their names. --kernel-id allows you to filter kernels by context, stream, name and invocation, similar to nvprof. Below is a typical command line invocation to collect the default set of data for all kernel launches in the target application:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nv-nsight-cu-cli -c 1 -s 10 -k semi_discrete_step -f -o miniWeather ./miniWeather`\n",
    "\n",
    "where command switch options used for this lab are:\n",
    "- `-c`: to specify number of kernel launches to collect\n",
    "- `-s`: to specify number of kernels to skip before collection starts\n",
    "- `-k`: to filter the kernels by a regex match of their names\n",
    "- `-f`: Overwrites the existing generated report\n",
    "- `-o`: name for the intermediate result file, created at the end of the collection (.nsight-cuprof-report or .ncu-rep filename)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customising data collection**: One may ask how would you decide on the number of kernels to skip and how many kernel launches to collect? Since data is collected per kernel, it makes sense to collect for more than one kernel launches if kernels have different behavior or performance characteristics. The decision on how many kernel launches to skip or collect depends on if you want to collect the performance metrics for those kernel launches or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to view the report\n",
    "The profiler report contains all the information collected during profiling for each kernel launch. When using CLI to profile the application, there are two ways to view the profiler's report. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) On the Terminal: By default, a temporary file is used to store profiling results, and data is printed to the command line. You can also use `--summary=per=kernel` option to view the summary of each kernel type on the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/summary-compute.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2) NVIDIA Nsight Compute UI: To permanently store the profiler report, use `-o` to specify the output filename. After the profiling session ends, a `*.nsight-cuprof-report` or `*.ncu-rep` file will be created. This file can be loaded into Nsight Compute UI using *File -> Open*. If you would like to view this on your local machine, this requires that the local system has CUDA toolkit installed of same version and the Nsight Compute UI version should match the CLI version. More details on where to download CUDA toolkit can be found in the “Links and Resources” at the end of this page.\n",
