    "The compiler has analyzed the loops in our two main functions and scheduled the iterations of the loops to run in parallel on our GPU and Multicore CPU. The compiler is usually pretty good at choosing how to break up loop iterations to run well on parallel accelerators, but sometimes we can eke out just a little more performance by guiding the compiler to make specific choices. First, let's look at the choices the compiler made for us. We'll focus on the `calcNext` routine, but you should look at the `swap` routine too. Here's the compiler feedback for that routine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "calcnext:\n",
    "     58, Generating copyin(a(:,:))\n",
    "         Accelerator kernel generated\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main loops on interest in `calcNext` are on lines 59 and 60. I see that the compiler has told me what loop clauses it chose for each of those loops. The outermost loop is treated as a *gang* loop, meaning it broke that loop up into chunks that can be spread out across the GPU or CPU cores easily. If you have programmed in CUDA before, you'll recognize that the compiler is mapping this loop to the CUDA thread blocks. The innermost loop is mapped instead to *vector* parallelism. You can think of a vector as some number of data cells that get the same operation applied to them at the same time. On any modern processor technology you need this mixture of *coarse grained* and *fine grained* parallelism to effectively use the hardware. Vector (fine grained) parallelism can operate extremely efficiently when performing the same operation on a bunch of data, but there's limits to how long a vector you can build. Gang (coarse grained) parallelism is highly scalable, because each chunk of work can operate completely independently of each other chunk, making it ideal for allowing processor cores to operate independently of each other.\n",

    "Did your code speed up at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "So when should you use the `collapse` clause? The collapse clause is particularly useful in two specific cases that occur when you have very deep loop nests (4, 5, or more loops nested together). The first case is when the innermost loops have very few iterations. The compiler will generally favor inner loops for *vector* parallelism, so if there's not enough loop iterations to fill our vector, we're going to be wasting our computational power. Take a loop at this code:\n",

    "    end do\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, our innermost loop, which the compiler will likely want to vectorize has just 8 iterations. On a CPU, this may be OK, but on a GPU we generally want longer vectors. If I collapse the two innermost loops together, that gives me 64 iterations, which is starting to get in the range where GPUs make sense. So instead, I should write this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "!$acc parallel loop\n",
    "do i = 1, N\n",
    "    !$acc loop collapse(2)\n",

    "end do\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other common case happens when you have sort-of short loops on the outermost loops of a loop nest. This is where the compiler looks first for *coarse grained* parallelism to spread across the CPU or GPU. If there's not enough parallelism here, then we're limited in how many CPU cores or how large a GPU we can effectively use. So in the example below, I took two 32 iteration loops and turn them into a single 1024 iteration loop to give the compiler the opportunity to parallelize the region on larger GPUs.\n",

    "As a rule of thumb, if your code has loops that are tightly-nested together, meaning there's nothing inside of one loop except the nested loop, it's worth trying to collapse the loops completely.
