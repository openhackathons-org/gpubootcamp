    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second lab of the OpenACC Online Course. In the first lab you learned how to accelerate a simple code on multicore CPUs and GPUs using OpenACC. This lab will build upon that lab by adding data optimization to the mix. The lab uses a Jupyter notebook, like this one, and the PGI Compiler. If you are not familiar with Jupyter, you may execute the commands in a cell by pressing ctrl-enter or pressing the \"Run\" button at the top of the page. This lab is available in C or Fortran, please choose the version that best fits your needs below.\n",
