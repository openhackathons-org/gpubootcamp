The parallel directive tells the compiler to \"redundantly parallelize\" the code. The `loop` directive specifically tells the compiler that we want the loop parallelized. Let's look at an example of why the loop directive is so important. The `parallel` directive tells the compiler to create somewhere to run parallel code. OpenACC calls that somewhere a `gang`, which might be a thread on the CPU or maying a CUDA threadblock or OpenCL workgroup. It will choose how many gangs to create based on where you're running, only a few on a CPU (like 1 per CPU core) or lots on a GPU (1000's possibly). Gangs allow OpenACC code to scale from small CPUs to large GPUs because each one works completely independently of each other gang. That's why there's a space between gangs in the images below.\n",

Instead I want to instruct the compiler to break up the iterations of my loop and to run them in parallel on the gangs. To do that, I simply add a `loop` directive to the interesting loops. This instructs the compiler that I want my loop to be parallelized and promises to the compiler that it's safe to do so. Now that I have both `parallel` and `loop`, things loop a lot better (and run a lot faster). Now the compiler is spreading my loop iterations to all of my gangs, but also running multiple iterations of the loop at the same time within each gang as a *vector*. Think of a vector like this, I have 10 numbers that I want to add to 10 other numbers (in pairs). Rather than looking up each pair of numbers, adding them together, storing the result, and then moving on to the next pair in-order, modern computer hardware allows me to add all 10 pairs together all at once, which is a lot more efficient. \n",

The compiler may make completely different decisions if I'm compiling for a multicore CPU than it would for a GPU and that's the idea. OpenACC enables programmers to parallelize their codes without having to worry about the details of how best to do so for every possible machine. \n",

    "There's one very important clause that you'll need to know for our example code: the `reduction` clause. Take note of how the loops in `calcNext` each calculate an error value and then compare against the maximum value to find an absolute maximum. When executing this operation in parallel, it's necessary to do a *reduction* in order to ensure you always get the correct answer. A reduction takes all of the values of `error` calculated in the loops and *reduces* them down to a single answer, in this case the maximum. There are a variety of reductions that can be done, but for our example code we only care about the max operation. We will inform the compiler about our reduction by adding a `reduction(max:error)` clause to the `acc parallel loop` in the `calcNext` function."
