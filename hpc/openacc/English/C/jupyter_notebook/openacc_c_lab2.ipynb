    "In order to build our example code without CUDA managed memory we need to give the compiler more information about the arrays. How do our two loop nests use the arrays `A` and `Anew`? The `calcNext` function take `A` as input and generates `Anew` as output, but also needs Anew copied in because we need to maintain that *hot* boundary at the top. So you will want to add a `copyin` clause for `A` and a `copy` clause for `Anew` on your region. The `swap` function takes `Anew` as input and `A` as output, so it needs the exact opposite data clauses. It's also necessary to tell the compiler the size of the two arrays by using array shaping. Our arrays are `m` times `n` in size, so we'll tell the compiler their shape starts at `0` and has `n*m` elements, using the syntax above. Go ahead and add data clauses to the two `parallel loop` directives in `laplace2d.c`.\n",

The `swap` function has very similar numbers. That means that the program is actually spending very little of its runtime doing calculations. Why is the program copying so much data around? The screenshot below comes from the Nsight Systems profiler and shows part of one step of our outer while loop. The greenish and pink colors are data movement and the blue colors are our kernels (calcNext and swap).

Instead, we see a red OpenACC `Enter Data` region which contains some greenish bars corresponding to host-to-device data transfer preceding any GPU kernel launches. This is because our data movement is now handled by the outer data region, not the data clauses on each loop. Data clauses count how many times an array has been placed into device memory and only copies data the outermost time it encounters an array. This means that the data clauses we added to our two functions are now used only for shaping and no data movement will actually occur here anymore, thanks to our outer `data` region.\n",

Just like we just did, you can add clauses to each of your OpenACC `parallel loop` or `kernels` regions to get everything running on the accelerator and then just wrap those functions with a data region when you're done and the data movement magically disappears. Furthermore, if you want to isolate one of those functions into a standalone test case you can do so easily, because the data clause is already in the code. "

The update directive will explicitly transfer data between the host and the device. The `update` directive has two clauses:\n",
