    "This is our last optimization, and arguably the most important one. In OpenACC, **Gang Worker Vector** is used to define additional levels of parallelism. Specifically for NVIDIA GPUs, gang, worker, and vector will specify the *decomposition* of our loop iterations to GPU threads. Each loop will have an optimal Gang/Worker/Vector implementation, and finding that correct implementation will often take a bit of thinking, and possibly some trial and error. So let's explain how the `gang`, `worker`, and `vector` clauses actually work.\n",

    "This image represents a single **gang**. When parallelizing our **for loops**, the **loop iterations** will be **broken up evenly** among a number of gangs. Each gang will contain a number of **threads**. These threads are organized into **blocks**. A **worker** is a row of threads. In the above graphic, there are 3 **workers**, which means that there are 3 rows of threads. The **vector** refers to how long each row is. So in the above graphic, the vector is 8, because each row is 8 threads long.\n",
